# Method Overload
--> Having two or more methods under same name but with different parameters || this is Method Overload
--> Method Signature: only Method name + Parameters.

##OOPS Object Oriented Programming

=->Encapsulation
    all the attributes and variables will be PRIVATE, only use Public if necessity.
    so in encapsulation we cannot access variables from outside.
    we can use getters and setter methods or use construction to access variables.

=->Inheritance
    Inheritance is basically Parent child relationship,
    so child class inherits properties of the parent class.

            ClassA
                int a
                int b
                int c

                public String display(){
                sout("Something");
                }

            ClassB inherits ClassA //here ClassA is a parent and ClassB is Child
                   int a
                   int b
                   int c

                   //Basically here we are overriding parent method by adding new sout statement.
                   public String display(){
                   sout("Something new in child")
                   sout("Something");
                   }

                   --multi level Inheritance
                   parent
                   |
                   child
                   |
                   grandchild

                   --multiple inheritance
                       parent
                   |           |
                   child1   child2

=->Abstraction
=->Polymorphism
